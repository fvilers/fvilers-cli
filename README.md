# fvilers

A CLI to know more about me!

# How to use

```
npm i -g fvilers
fvilers
```

If you prefer not to install globally this CLI, you can use `npx fvilers` but Node will need to temporary download and/or install various packages on each execution.

## Note

This package has been forked from [Sindre Sorhus CLI](https://github.com/sindresorhus/sindresorhus) and adapted with my data.
